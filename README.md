# 👋 Hey, I'm Hrushi Bhatt

I'm a Computer Engineering student at Iowa State University who enjoys building smart, hands-on projects that combine hardware and software. I’ve worked on robots, data-driven apps, and interactive UIs, and I’m always exploring new technologies to improve how things work.
